# Go Ethereum Block Explorer 🚀  

A modern, lightweight, and high-performance **Ethereum block explorer** built with **Go**.  
This project is designed to provide developers, researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts with a minimal yet powerful tool to **explore the Ethereum blockchain**. Think of it as a simplified version of [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io), but focused on speed, clarity, and extensibility.  

With this explorer, you can easily fetch and analyze **blocks, transactions, and account balances** in **real-time**, while benefiting from caching and WebSocket-based updates.
